## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to effectively center content to the middle of the viewport using CSS Grid and `min-height`.

```css
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
}
```

I also practiced using CSS variables to maintain a consistent color palette.

Additionally, I learned about the importance of `max-width` for responsive design, allowing the card to have a fixed width on desktop while remaining fluid on smaller screens.
